### Introduction
**Targeted Level of Achievement**: Apollo 11

Trendly wants you to be seen. 
Trendly aims to empower student entrepreneurs by enhancing discoverability of their businesses, and ease the labour of buyers who have to comb through advertisements to find them. Ultimately, we want to foster a thriving community of young businesses and encourage youth entrepreneurship in Singapore, all while preserving the familiar and long-standing practice of buying on Telegram.

**Problem Statement & Motivation**: The motivation for engaging in profitable side hustles has always been strong among university students, who are known for their high consumption patterns. It is no surprise, then, that student-led small businesses are flourishing. Notable examples include local thrift stores initiated by students in Singapore, such as Woofie and Rage Vintage. Additionally, numerous small businesses specialising in handmade items, often operated by just a few youths, are emerging.

As university students with a strong appetite for material goods, particularly apparel and handmade products, we see immense potential in streamlining and facilitating sales for these businesses to their target audience. Currently, these shops, largely online, find their buyers through social media platforms like Telegram, word-of-mouth, or trading “shoutouts” with other similar online businesses.

For buyers, this system presents several challenges:

*Advertisement Flooding*: Buyers are often overwhelmed with advertisements, facing an uncategorized and disorganised array of options.
*Trust Issues*: The reliance on a system of mutual good faith can lead to scams and wasted resources.
*Inconvenient Search*: Buyers must hunt for the items they want by combing through various channels, while sellers need to publicise their products on platforms scattered across the app.

Our app aims to address these issues by providing a centralised marketplace, simplifying the transaction process, and increasing the discoverability of student-run businesses. By doing so, we not only support student entrepreneurs but also enhance the shopping experience for their peers.
